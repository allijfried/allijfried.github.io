	<h3>About Me</h3>
	<p>I am a detail-oriented, creative, and self-motivated designer. I’ve always been a very quick learner and I don’t quit until I succeed. I am a team player and enjoy collaborating with others. The best projects, as I have learned, are born of collective efforts.  <br>

	I started my experience in design working at a package design firm. Through my current job and freelance work, I have gained a tremendous amount of experience and knowledge.  I have become fascinated and intrigued with web design. This leads to where I am now; a student at Startup Institute where I can explore my passion for UX/UI design.  I look forward to leveraging my strengths to in my future as a Web Designer. </p>
